The file ex1data2.txt is intended to be used by students of Coursera's Machine Learning course, 
as an alternate sample data set for the first programming exercise, to test multivariate linear regression. 
The lines are results for a 5K race held in Millburn, NJ, USA, in 2014. 
The first column is the age in years of the participant
The second column is the gender of the participant (-1 for male, 1 for female)
The third column is the race result in seconds. 

I used this data set to train my multivariate linear regression model, 
then I asked the model to predict the race time for a 53 year old man. 
It predicted the 53 year old man could run a 5K race in 1699.08 seconds, 
in otherwords about 28 minutes and 19 seconds.
